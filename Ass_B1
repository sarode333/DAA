Implement a problem of activity selection problem with K persons.

Statement: Given two arrays S[] and E[] of size N denoting starting and closing time of the shops and an integer value K denoting the 
number of people, the task is to find out the maximum number of shops they can visit in total if they visit each shop optimally based 
on the following conditions:

. A shop can be visited by only one person
. A person cannot visit another shop if its timing collide with it
Input: S[] = {1, 8, 3, 2, 6}, E[] = {5, 10, 6, 5, 9}, K = 2
Output: 4
Input: S[] = {1, 2, 3}, E[] = {3, 4, 5}, K = 2
Output: 3


Program:

#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

struct Shop {
    int start;
    int end;
};

bool sortByClosingTime(const Shop& a, const Shop& b) {
    return a.end < b.end;
}

int maxShopsToVisit(std::vector<Shop>& shops, int k) {
    int n = shops.size();
    
    // Sort the shops by closing times
    std::sort(shops.begin(), shops.end(), sortByClosingTime);

    int visited = 1; // First shop is always visited
    int prevShop = 0; // Index of the last visited shop
    
    for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
        if (shops[i].start > shops[prevShop].end) {
            visited++;
            prevShop = i;
        }
        if (visited == k) {
            break; // All persons have visited a shop
        }
    }

    return visited;
}

int main() {
    int N = 5; // Number of shops
    int K = 3; // Number of people

    std::vector<Shop> shops = {{1, 3}, {2, 5}, {3, 7}, {5, 8}, {6, 9}};
    
    int maxShops = maxShopsToVisit(shops, K);
    std::cout << "Maximum number of shops that can be visited: " << maxShops << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
